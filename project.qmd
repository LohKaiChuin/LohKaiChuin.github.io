## Minecraft Infographics

During my time in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, I had to redesign elements from an application in the appstore. I had chosen Minecraft as my main application.

I had to create an infographic about the application and it was all done from scratch using Adobe Photoshop. All the individual assets was traced carefully using Adobe Illustrator.

Of the many design related projects that I had done up, I felt that this was especially well made for someone with close to no experience in creating an infographic, which provides me with motivation to continue improving on my design sense.
