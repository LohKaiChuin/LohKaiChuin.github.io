2nd Year Applied Computing student interested in becoming a data scientist

## Biology

Previously from Institute of Technical Education pursuing Information Technology in 2019 and Ngee Ann Polytechnic pursuing Data Science in 2021, I have continued my education pursuit in Applied Computing, with a specialisation in Fintech in the Singapore Institute of Technology.

I strive to gain enough experience in the field to pursue to greater heights in the technology field as a data scientist and engineer.

The idea of working with numbers and data to discover interesting analysis and insights keeps me motivated to work in this field.

## Interests
1. Python
2. Data Science and Machine Learning
3. Audio and Sound Systems

## Hobbies

1. Learning Languages

Being a bilingual, learning more languages is especially fun, being able to surprise others by speaking in their native tongue. One language that I am currently still trying to master is Japanese, with me picking up French and Malay with different group of friends.

2. Travelling

With the passion of learning languages, travelling is a given, with my top travel destination to Japan to immerse myself in the language so that I can learn the language faster and keep myself updated to their slangs. 

3. Instrument Playing

Having learned the trumpet since Secondary School, I currently own and practice on my trumpet at home as a hobby. I am also interested in playing the percussion and occassionally drumming to beats on pots and pans at home.
