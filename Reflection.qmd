The user of GenAI is especially helpful but can easily be abused by many.

Personally I prefer to use ChatGPT amongst the other available options due to its diverse training data, allowing it to provide more accurate information.

GenAI had helped me troubleshoot this assessment with several issues such as troubleshooting an error I faced when creating Pages in Github.

While ChatGPT is beneficial in resolving issues, a problem faced is the ethics of GenAI and us humans need to use it as a learning and aid tool instead of using it to do our work completely.
