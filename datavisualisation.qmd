## Diabetes Data Visualisation

In my previous course of work in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, I had to use Jupyter Notebook to pick up on Machine Learning. 

One of the interesting visualisations I encountered was a correlation table, which looks like a heatmap in a sense.

The correlation table shows the different factors which causes and affects the risk of diabetes. Although it looks simple, it was the first data visualisation I had created using Matplotlib's pyplot module.
